/**
 * A resumed run keeps writing to its own conversation (#3328).
 *
 * The run row's `conversation_id` is the single record of which thread a run belongs
 * to, and it is written once at creation. An explicit resume that mints a fresh
 * conversation therefore does not move the run — it just sends the resumed segment
 * somewhere the run never references, and the run's own thread stops at the pause.
 *
 * These spawn the real CLI against a scratch `ARCHON_HOME` because the observable
 * outcome is rows: one run, one conversation, across a resume. An in-process test of
 * the options object would assert the call shape instead, which is the thing that was
 * already "correct" at three other sites while this one silently was not.
