/**
 * Credential-validity reader for the Pi auth store (#3274).
 *
 * `doctor`'s Pi check used to report `pass` when `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` merely
 * existed. A Pi OAuth grant that expired months ago also has its file on disk,
 * so an install whose every Pi workflow failed still got a green doctor — the
 * file's presence is necessary, not sufficient.
 *
 * The reader lives here, next to the Pi SDK it mirrors, for two reasons:
 *
 * 1. `@archon/providers` already owns Pi's SDK and its shapes. The CLI package
 *    deliberately does not depend on the Pi SDK, so a copy of the credential
 *    shape kept in `packages/cli` had nothing pinning it to the real thing —
 *    if Pi renamed a field, `doctor` would quietly report the wrong verdict.
 *    Importing the types from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` removes the copy.
 * 2. The acceptance rules below are the SDK's own. `auth-storage.ts`'s
 *    `load()` rejects a store whose entries do not match them, so a store
 *    `doctor` calls usable but the SDK refuses is a store that cannot
 *    authenticate anything. `doctor` should agree with the runtime.
 *
 * Scope: read the store Archon already reads and nothing else. No network probe
 * (a network failure is its own state, not an invalid credential), no scanning
 * of other tools' credential stores. Credential *values* are never returned or
 * logged — provider ids, state, and the expiry timestamp only.

 * Callers must not treat it as a hard failure: a false alarm on a healthy
 * install is worse than the false pass this reader replaced (#3274).
 *
 * The reader deliberately does not attempt the refresh itself. `doctor` reads
 * the store the user's own `pi /login` wrote; Archon's refresh path
 * (`getOAuthApiKey` → `user-provider-key-store`) reads a *different* store —
