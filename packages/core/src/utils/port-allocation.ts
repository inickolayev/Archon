/**
 * Resolve a worktree's port: the hashed offset when it is free, otherwise the next

 *
 * Exported for testing: reaching this through `getPort()` requires the suite itself to
 * be running inside a worktree, so a collision test written against `getPort()` passes
 * by skipping in the main repo — including in CI, where it would never once exercise
 * the fallback it claims to cover.
 *
 * The hash is a convenience — "this worktree, this port, every time" — not a value
 * anything else recomputes, so yielding it to a live listener costs nothing a caller
 * can observe. 900 offsets is a small space: collisions between worktrees reach
 * roughly even odds around 35 of them, and any unrelated local process holding a port
 * in 3190–4089 collides too. Scanning forward from the hashed offset keeps the result
 * stable for a given occupancy rather than reshuffling every worktree.
 *
 * Racy by construction: another process can take the port between this probe and
 * `Bun.serve`. Closing that window means holding the socket from here to the server,
 * which this function does not own. The probe removes the common case — a port
 * already held when the server starts — and leaves the narrow one to the bind error.
